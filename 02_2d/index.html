#### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fusion 360 Tutorial</p>
<p>I worked through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc&ab_channel=CADCAMTutorials">a Fusion 360 Tutorial for beginners</a> and sketched the following on Fusion 360. I learned a lot of the keyboard shortcuts and the basics for the software.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Press-Kit Construction Kit</p>
<p>I began with the press-kit construction kit by working through a generic shape. Since hexagons are the bestagons, I started with that polygon in Fusion 360. Then, I measured that the thickness of the cardboard is 4.40 mm and approximated the kerf to be 0.4 mm to derive the notch widths of 4.0 mm. I also decided for the notch to be 10 mm long.</p>

<p>From there, I extruded the shape without the notches and filleted the edges to facilitate the construction of an abstract object with these hexagon shapes. I then projected the shape back down to the plan to create this outline projection to laser cut.</p>
<p>The final product is the below! I enjoyed printing out these hexagons and creating a fun sculpture.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Press-Kit Construction Kit, Continued</p>
<p>I then was inspired by <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-to-make-almost-anything/">a blog from Joel at MIT admissions</a> to laser cut the pieces to construct a soccer ball. I thought it looked so cool so I decided to give it a try. I designed two main pieces: a hexagon and pentagon.</p>

<p>I used a similar approach to create these shapes as I did for the abstract hexagons and did my best to estimate the dimensions for the teeth joints that combine the shapes together. When I layed each of the printed pieces down, it came together nicely. However, when I tried to actual assemble the pieces, it was difficult to navigate the teeth after the first layer.</p>

<p>I then tried to prototype it and adjust the teeth length by cutting them in half with scissors but that still didn't work too well. Unfortunately, I didn't have more time to pursue this option further.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">3D Modeling Miscellaneous Objects</p>
<p>First, I decided to model a cup from HUDS. To do so, I measured the diameter of the cup at the top and the diameter of the cup from the bottom. I also measured the thickness of the lip around the cup and the depth of the ledge for the bottom of the cup. Pictures of those measurements are below.</p>

<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_2.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_3.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_4.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_5.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_6.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Cup_Measure_7.jpg"></image>

<p>I used construction tools like lofting and shelling to create the cup shape. I also used the rotation feature to create the lip of the cup. The final outcome is below.</p>

<p>Second, I decided to model a screwdriver that was in the lab. For this, I measured the general shapes of the screwdriver tip and the handle.</p>

<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Driver-4.jpg"></image>
<image width="20%" height="20%" src="./Driver-5.jpg"></image>

<p>I then used layers of sketches which the plane being on the surface of each figure. This is so that I can stack of of the separate components of the screwdriver. Also, I used the rotation tool to create the handle and the fillet to round the edges of the base of the grip.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Using the Vinyl Cutter</p>
<p>After seeing the demo for the vinyl cutter, I also tried it out for myself. I printed out a simple rectangle to just try the cutter. I then used the transfer tape and was able to remove it from the cut smoothly.</p>
