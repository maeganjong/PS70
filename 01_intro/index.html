#### Week 1: Introduction
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Final project ideas in ranking of preference</p>
<ul>
  <li>Idea 1: Ergonomic wearable technology</li>
  <p>Create wearables for the wrist, neck, and waist to detect when bad sitting posture is occurring. I plan to detect extreme angles in the neck or wrists or misalignment in the waist and then notify users on their desktop when their seating position needs to be fixed. I think it would also be cool to provide a record across days on how their posture has been historically so their physicians can provide more in-depth recommendations to improve their ergonomics.</p>

  <p>Relevant resource: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865302/">Wearable Devices for Ergonomics: A Systematic Literature Review</a></p>
  <li>Idea 2: Card detecting wallet</li> 
  This smart wallet can detect which cards are currently in your wallet or not. Since cards now have tap technology, I'd like to create a mobile app that notifies the individual when a card has been removed from the wallet.
  
  I anticipate sensors on the wallet that might use the tap technology to scan or acknowledge when there are certain cards in the wallet. Also, I anticipate needing to register the cards in the wallet first so that the wallet sensor would know which specific card is removed at any given moment.
  
  Existing solutions which only track the wallet but not the contents: <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/clothing/g41248558/best-smart-wallets/">10 Best Smart Wallets of 2023</a></p>
  <li>Idea 3: Waterbottle cleanliness monitor</li>
  This add-on to the water bottle would detect current water quality and signal a time to clean the water bottle. It would also rate water quality from public fountains with immediate signals and indicators. I anticipate including either a monitor on the water bottle or as an app for users to see the water status.
