#### Week 5: 3D Programming

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">3D Printing Rings</h3>

<p>For this week, I wanted to make a link of rings since I was fascinated how people online were able to develop sheets of chain mail.</p>

<p>My first attempt was not great since I realized with an infill of 20% and really thin rings, it was impossible to break off the supports without ruining the rings themselves.</p>

<div class="c">
    <image width="20%" height="100%" src="./Thin_Rings_Support.jpg"></image>
    <image width="20%" height="100%" src="./Thin_Rings.jpg"></image> 
    </div>
<p>For my next, I increased the infill to 40% and increased the thickness of the rings. I made my test run with just two and it turned out well!</p>

<div class="c">
    <video width="25%" height="100%" controls><source src="2_Rings.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <image width="20%" height="100%" src="./2_Rings.jpg"></image> 
    </div>

<p>After my test runs with two rings, I wanted to increase the number of links. One thing I quickly learned was that the positioning of the chains is a bit tricky. Factors I considered were how thick each ring was and how I would place multiple rings through one hoop without any overlap. I learned a neat Utility tool on Fusion 360 which checks for intersections between objects. I was able to use this to ensure that none of my rings were touching since it was difficult to know for sure just by eye.</p>

<div class="c">
    <video controls><source src="Chains.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <image src="./Multi_Link_Supports.jpg"></image> 
    </div>

<p>The rings came out nicely but if I could change one thing, I'd want to spend more time thinking about how to place the rings so that I would use less supports and cut down on the time to free the links from the supports!</p>

<p>You can download the final documents for the rings: <a href='./Chain Link.f3d' download >3D model file</a>, <a href='./Chain Links.stl' download >STL file</a>, and <a href='./Chain_Links_0.4n_0.3mm_PLA_MK3S_4h11m.gcode' download >sliced gcode file</a>.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Scanning a Bust</h3>
<p>I had a bit of a hard time with RevoPoint since I tried to scan everyday objects like pens, dice, glue bottle, etc. but it had a hard time tracking the point clouds. Therefore, I stuck with their provided bust and alas, it came out perfectly. The picture of the scan is below and you can downloud the obj file <a href='./bust.obj' download >here</a>.</p>
